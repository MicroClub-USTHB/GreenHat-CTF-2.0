    description: During his usual afternoon rounds at the club's HQ, Kenpatchi heard a strange noise echoing from one of the local. Curious, he went to investigate only to find the place in a mess and a mysterious bear-like figure escaping through the window. Kenpatchi gave chase, but the intruder was too fast. Luckily, the bear was clumsy  it dropped a badge, and even more interestingly, a strange broken device that resembled a phone.The device emitted a weird signal and loud static pulsse before powering down. That signal was intercepted and recorded as a file, now stored somewhere among the images in the club's Discord server. Looks like this bear leaves more than just paw prints.... Trace the intruder and recover the flag.
