  description:
    "I hashed 3 more of my most secret passwords with SHA256. To make the passwords even more unbreakable, I mutated each one according to the following rules:

    Password 1: Append 3 characters at the end, in the following order: a special character, a number, and an uppercase letter
    Password 2: A typo was made when typing the password. Consider a typo to mean a single-character deletion from the password
    Password 3: Make the password leet (and since I'm nice, I'll tell you a hint: only vowels are leetified!)
    I'm confident you'll never be able to crack my hashes now! Do your worst!
