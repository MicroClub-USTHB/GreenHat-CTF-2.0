## Solution : 
The goal of this challenge is to show that not every osint cahllenge with a charcter is tied to the basic social media (instagram, twitter, reddit), allthough it's a good reflex to always start with sherlock, howevr for this challenge the player needs to google the name `ronin hakim` for him to find this website https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/user.do?id=1249929 The platform where Ronin hakim documents his activities.     
There u can find his last run alongside El Kerma beach, and if u go to google maps and visit that exact place (the place where his last run began and ended) and check it's reviews they will find a review of one of his friends hinting that he moved to a place called `حي بومرداس` or something.   
If you go back to go back to google maps and type that in you will find two places with that name in google maps. one in Ain Errich (it was a fake flag in it's review), and one in Touggourt that has a sheet (csv) in it's review.    
It contains a bunch of coordinates (lats,longs), the player needs to upload the file on google my maps and it will trace out the flag.
